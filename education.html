            <strong>California State University, Fullerton</strong> – B.S. in Computer Science (Graduated 2025)
            <p>
                As part of my senior capstone project, I worked with a team to build a machine learning system combining an Instantaneously Trained Neural Network (ITNN) and YOLO object detection. I handled much of the Python implementation, focusing on how the system responded to different real-world images. This taught me a lot about practical AI applications and collaborative development.

            <strong>Citrus College</strong> – A.S. in Computer Science (Graduated 2022)
            <p>
                While studying at Citrus, I created a 3D version of <em>Crossy Road</em> using Unity. It featured obstacle-based movement, randomly generated traffic, and customizable avatars. The project sparked my interest in game development and reinforced my passion for combining art and code.
