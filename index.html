    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I’m Daniel Joseph Corona. I recently graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a strong passion for technology, teaching, and making learning fun. My journey into programming started with video games, but quickly expanded into game development, web technologies, and machine learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing video games, but I was just as curious about how they were made. That curiosity led me to learn programming, and eventually build my own projects using tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Pygame. I really enjoy mixing creativity with code — whether that’s designing a game level or figuring out how to make something work behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Citrus College, I built a 3D remake of <em>Crossy Road</em> in Unity, where I learned how to turn ideas into playable experiences. Later, for my senior capstone at CSUF, I worked with a team to develop a machine learning project combining YOLO object detection and a trained neural network. I focused on the Python side — testing and refining its accuracy. Both projects gave me hands-on experience with problem-solving, debugging, and teamwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve also taught myself tools like Pygame and React. Sharing what I learn has always been important to me — I love helping others understand concepts in a fun, relatable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe coding builds confidence, curiosity, and creativity — and I’d love to help the next generation discover the joy of technology just like I did.
