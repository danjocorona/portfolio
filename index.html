    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I’m Daniel Joseph Corona. I recently graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a degree in Computer Science, and I’ve always been drawn to how technology can bring ideas to life — especially through games and practical tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing video games, but I was just as curious about how they were made. That curiosity led me to learn programming, and eventually build my own projects using tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Pygame. I really enjoy mixing creativity with code — whether that’s designing a game level or figuring out how to make something work behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most rewarding experiences I had in college was working on my capstone project. My team built a computer vision system using YOLO nueral net for object detection, and an IFNN. I focused on the Python side of the project, including testing and refining how it responded to different inputs. It was challenging, but it taught me a lot about problem-solving and teamwork.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also into web development — I’ve worked with Python, JavaScript, React, and Firebase, and I recently published a small arcade game called <strong>Fruit Collector</strong>. It runs in the browser using WebAssembly, and it was a fun way to bring everything I’ve learned together in one project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now I’m building up my portfolio and looking for opportunities to grow as a developer. I’m especially interested in roles that let me learn from others, build useful or fun things, and keep leveling up my skills.
