    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Daniel, a recent Computer Science graduate from CSUF with a strong interest in full-stack development and game programming.
      My love for video games as a kid made me wonder: "How are these created?" That curiosity led me down the path to becoming a programmer.
      I enjoy building practical applications that solve real-world problems, and I’m especially drawn to projects where I can mix creativity with technology.
